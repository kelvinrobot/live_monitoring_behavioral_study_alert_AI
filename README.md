Models built: are highly complex unsupervised deep learning models that studies hidden features.

Time-Series Transformer – learns sequential patterns.

Sequence VAE (Anomaly Detection) – reconstructs time-series, flags anomalies.

Contrastive Representation Learner – learns embeddings for anomaly detection.

Temporal Graph Neural Network (GCN) – models synthetic relationships between entities.

Tabular MLP Classifier – detects anomalies in tabular features.
